# Joe Rogan Analysis
I, like 7+ million others, enjoy watching/listening to the Joe Rogan Experience Youtube channel and podcast.

### Analyses
- Speaking proportions between Joe and guests
    - all-time
    - change in speaking proportions across episodes over time (i.e. from episode #700 to #1000)
    - change in speaking proportions within an episode (i.e. in first 25%, second 25%, ..., last 25%)
    - segmented by guest vocation (i.e. scientist, comedian, conspiracy theorist)
- Conversation flow
    - average monologue length
